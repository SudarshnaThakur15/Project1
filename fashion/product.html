  <p class="product"><span class="hlight"> It’s more than just an outfit.</span><br>
    It probably goes without saying, but the clothes we wear can be an expression (either consciously or subconsciously) of 
    how we’re feeling. I don’t know about you, but I tend to make my outfit choices based on the kind of mood I’m in. 
    Ready to take on the world? Hair back, activewear on. Excited for a date night? Something cute, obviously. In need of comfort? 
    Yep, sweats it is.<br>
    
    But this can work in the reverse too. Have you ever noticed your entire mood change based on which clothes you
    pull out from your wardrobe? You might be feeling kind of blue, until you put on your bright orange mohair knit 
    and a pair of dangly gold earrings.<br>
    
   
           </p>
           <p class="product"> <span class="hlight">Is there a link between fashion and mood?</span><br>
            According to Michelle, there is a reciprocal relationship between the clothes we wear and how we feel. 
            However, this often plays out in such small ways that it can sometimes be overlooked.<br>
            “We know that our mood can influence our fashion choices for the day, as we often dress in ways to match our mood,” she says. “Our self-care or little habits, like dressing up or putting on makeup, tend to be one of the first things to drop off when feeling stressed or depressed.”<br>
            But this goes both ways. Michelle says that the choices we make about our wardrobe and our outfits can have a real impact on our emotional state. “Fashion psychology researchers have termed this relationship ‘enclothed cognition’
             – which refers to the influence that clothes have on the psychology of the person wearing them,” she explains.<br>

                  <p >Hoddies are the LOve.Especially when it comes to fashion and comfort hoddies steal the show.
                     It can make your look aligent  to outlaw just the way you carry it.
                    Gray is a colour which can suit to anybody no matters what is your bodytype ,Male or Female.
                    I have to say gray is colour that merges with winter .Prevents you from winter and same time fashionable.
                    When it comes to women it is already uneasy to choose the outfit for the day in winters.So why not Keep 
                    a Plain Crop Hoodie
                    in your closet that will fit almost everything.
